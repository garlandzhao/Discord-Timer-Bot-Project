# Discord-Timer-Bot-Project :alarm_clock:

This project focuses on creating a timer bot for personal use. The bot is an alternative to timers found on webpages and phones. Users who frequently use Discord may appreciate the added convenience. Timers can be set with a few words on Discord. The bot will alert the caller with a simple ping and message.
The bot was created with Python and Visual Studio.

Main Python Libraries used:
- discord
- asyncio
- datetime
- pytz

## Features :clipboard:
- Simple to use 
- Easy to read
- Live countdown*
- Can create multiple timers
- Can include a message with each timer
- Can cancel ongoing timers
- View the time and date of any place in the world

## Notes :pencil2:
- *The countdown feature does not display any seconds due to concerns of rate limiting and latency
- This bot must be self-hosted
- Users must input their own bot token
- Users must enable intents on the discord bot page
